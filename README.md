# CreateExcelSample
## NOTE: This was written in VSCode on Linux. ##

Just a simple sample C# app to demonstrate how to create an Excel spreadsheet. This was done to help a co-worker who had to create Excel docs in C# web code.

*There is a NuGet refernence to DocumentFormat.OpenXml*
*There are some supporting classes used to simulate reading from something like an OracleDataReader.
