# CreateExcelSample
## NOTE: This was written in VSCode on Linux. ##

Just a simple C# app demonstrating how to create an Excel spreadsheet. This was done to help a co-worker who had to create Excel docs in C# web code. I thought someone else may find it helpful.

* There is a NuGet reference to DocumentFormat.OpenXml

* There are some supporting classes used to simulate reading from something like an OracleDataReader.
